# CLAUDE.md — Youth Camp Platform

> **Scope:** the real **camp** app — TS/Express backend (`src/`) + `public/` SPA. The offline demos live in `../youth app demo/CLAUDE.md` (that folder is the Vercel deploy source for the **demo** at `yc-camp-demo`). **This repo auto-deploys the real app to https://my-youth-camp.vercel.app on push to `master`.** Project map: `../CLAUDE.md`. Sibling app: `../youth-allocation-platform/CLAUDE.md`. Change workflow: `../CHANGE-PROMPTS.md`.

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this package. Read this before editing.

## What this is

A **combined** youth camp management platform that merges two previously separate apps:

- **Hub** (pre-camp): registrant management, accommodation allocation, blue card & payment tracking, registration codes, FAQ
- **Portal** (at-camp): daily check-in (twice daily), student notes, zone notifications, schedule, devotionals, contact search, CSV import

An admin can switch the entire app between modes via `POST /admin/mode`. Other logged-in sessions pick up the mode change automatically on next home-tab navigation (no logout required) — `RENDER.home` re-fetches `/settings` and rebuilds tabs if `campMode` changed.

The app is **platform-agnostic**: persistence is in-memory (optionally snapshotted to JSON files), with a Supabase backend in progress. Swapping to a real DB touches only `src/container.ts` + new repository implementations.

## ✅ DEPLOYED — live on Supabase (2026-06-22)

**Production: https://my-youth-camp.vercel.app** (`PERSISTENCE=supabase`). The port from
in-memory to a real Supabase backend is done and serving traffic.

| | |
|---|---|
| **GitHub** | `citipointe-youth/my-youth-camp` — **auto-deploys from `master`** |
| **Vercel** | team `citipointe-youth`, project `my-youth-camp` (serverless via `api/index.ts`) |
| **Supabase** | ref `nwfafrgojqkxylbppywo` (Sydney); all 16 tables applied; reached via `DATABASE_URL` (transaction pooler) |
| **Login** | `admin` (username, not email); password set in the DB post-deploy |

Trackers: **`CHANGELOG.txt`** (phase-by-phase + KNOWN RISKS, several now resolved — see
"PHASE 6: DEPLOYMENT"), `docs/DEPLOYMENT-DESIGN.md`, `docs/REMAINING-WORK.md`,
`docs/verification/` (Python harness), `docs/archive/` (historical).

### ⚠️ Two deploy-only gotchas — DON'T regress these (neither is caught by `tsc`/`vitest`)
1. **`tsconfig` must emit CommonJS** (`module: CommonJS`, `moduleResolution: Node`). Switching
   back to `ESNext`/`Bundler` makes `@vercel/node` crash on load with *"Cannot use import
   statement outside a module"* (it runs the traced output as CJS). Mirrors the CMS config.
2. **`.gitignore` must keep the `/data/` rule anchored** (leading slash). An unanchored
   `data/` also matches `src/data/`, which silently drops `src/data/seed.ts` from git — CLI
   deploys still work but the git auto-deploy fails with *"Cannot find module './data/seed'"*.

### Status of the bigger roadmap
- **Gate 0 passes** — `npm run typecheck` clean, **186 tests pass** (the once-pending compiler gate, R1, is closed). After the 2026-06-23 audit, test count will be higher (new tests added — see Audit fixes below).
- **Supabase repo layer is complete and wired** (`PERSISTENCE==='supabase'` branch in `container.ts`); migrations applied; all repos verified round-tripping in prod (R11 closed).
- **Phase 1 (Person unification) is still HALF-DONE BY DESIGN.** The unified `Person` entity/repo/service exist, are tested, AND the Supabase layer targets the `people` table — but the live read/write paths still run on the separate `Registrant`/`Camper` services. The "Step 4" switchover (`docs/STEP4-SWITCHOVER.md`) is still pending (R2). Don't assume `Person` is the live path.
- **Fixed defects** (now compiler-confirmed): app-won't-start, accommodation availability (B1), reset/new-year (A3/A4), timezone (B3), CSV import perf + BOM (C1), remind scoping (C2), stateless auth + security headers + login rate-limit.

### Audit fixes applied (2026-06-23)
A deep audit across three areas was completed and all bugs addressed. Key changes:

**Permissions & RBAC:**
- `attendance:write` is now a separate permission from `checkin:write`. `firstAid` gets `attendance:write` (sign-in/out only); all other roles get both. `PersonService.signEvent` asserts `attendance:write`; `checkIn` still asserts `checkin:write`. firstAid is now blocked from daily session check-ins at the API level, not just the UI.

**Mode switching:**
- `RENDER.home` re-fetches `/settings` on every home-tab navigation and silently updates `CAMP_MODE` + rebuilds tabs if the admin switched mode on another device. No logout required.

**SPA bug fixes:**
- **BUG-04**: `chevron` and `clock` added to `ICONS` — firstAid rows, wizard, and schedule tab no longer show blank SVGs.
- **BUG-05**: `TAB_OF.schedule` corrected from `'home'` to `'schedule'` — firstAid Schedule tab now highlights correctly.
- **BUG-06**: Dead `api('/campers')` call removed from `renderOversightPulse` — no more double fetch on every at-camp home load.
- **BUG-07**: Leader phone numbers in search results now use `telLink()` — tappable on mobile.
- **BUG-03**: `revealMedicare` no longer re-fetches `/campers/:id`; uses `_currentCasualtyCard` set by `openCasualtyCard` — audit POST still fires.
- **BUG-09**: Director gets a wide-nav sidebar (`Home, Check-in, Search, Notes, Import, Records & Export`) instead of a blank nav. Records & Export tile already shown for director on the admin console.
- **BUG-16**: `doNewYear()` year is now `SETTINGS.year + 1` (not `new Date().getFullYear() + 1`).

**Wipe guard (BUG-01, BUG-02, BUG-19):**
- `adminNewYear()` (Admin → Data path) now redirects to the guided close-out flow instead of calling the backend without `force`/`confirmWipe`. The "Purge & start new year" button is replaced with a link to Records & Export.
- `adminReset()` now requires typing the confirmation string AND sends `force:true` + `confirmWipe` to the backend. 409 responses show a modal pointing to Records & Export.
- Admin → Data no longer has two competing new-year paths (BUG-19 resolved).

**Backend:**
- **BUG-08**: Audit controller reads settings *after* the service call so `lastExportedAt` stamp never races with `lastTempPasswords` clearing.
- Import service preserves existing `elvantoMeta` on update if the CSV row has no `dateSubmitted`.

**New tests:**
- `access-control.test.ts`: 6 firstAid permission + `canAccessPerson`/`canAccessChurch` cases (BUG-11).
- `import.service.test.ts`: 3 dry-run cases — no-persist, phantom-church, `dryRun:true` in result (BUG-10).
- `person.service.test.ts`: 4 `listMedicalWatch` cases — atCamp filter, departed excluded, church scoping, firstAid access (BUG-12).
- `admin.characterisation.test.ts`: `BadRequestError` import added; `force:true` alone throws `BadRequestError` for `newYear` (BUG-13).

## Commands (run from this folder)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # backend + frontend on http://localhost:4200 (tsx watch)
npm run start        # same, no watch
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit (strict)
npm run test         # vitest
```

Default port: **4200**. Set `PORT=xxxx` to override.

### Persistence modes & env vars

| `PERSISTENCE` | Backend |
|---|---|
| `memory` (default) | In-memory; demo seed runs on startup |
| `json` | In-memory + JSON files in `DATA_DIR` |
| `supabase` | Supabase Postgres (requires `DATABASE_URL`) — **the live production backend** (ref `nwfafrgojqkxylbppywo`; use the transaction-pooler URL on port 6543, not the IPv6-only direct host) |

```
PORT=4200
NODE_ENV=production
PERSISTENCE=supabase           # production; "memory" for local dev with seed data
DATABASE_URL=<supabase-connection-string>
SESSION_SECRET=<32+ random bytes>   # REQUIRED in prod — tokens are forgeable without it (warns on startup)
DATA_DIR=./data                # only for PERSISTENCE=json
CORS_ORIGINS=https://camp.<your-domain>   # lock this; '*' warns in prod
```

Auth is **stateless HMAC sessions** (signed with `SESSION_SECRET`) — no server-side token
store, so logout is client-side and tokens stay valid until their 12h TTL.

## Architecture

```
api (Express) → controllers → services → repositories (interfaces) → core
```

- **`src/core/`** — pure types, entities, enums, Zod schemas, errors. No imports from other layers.
- **`src/repositories/`** — interfaces (DB-swap surface) + in-memory implementations + JSON file persistence.
- **`src/services/`** — all business logic + RBAC. Depend on repo *interfaces* only.
- **`src/api/`** — thin controllers → declarative route table (`http/router.ts`) → Express adapter. Express lives only under `src/api/http/` and `src/api/middleware/`.
- **`src/container.ts`** — composition root. The only file that names concrete repositories.

## Roles

| Role | Scope | Key capabilities |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `church` | Own church | Registrant read/write, daily check-in, write notes |
| `zoneLeader` | Own zone | All of above (zone-scoped), read notes, send zone notices, read registrants in zone |
| `director` | All | All of above (camp-wide), import, camp-wide notices |
| `admin` | All + back office | Everything + admin:manage (settings, accounts, accommodation, FAQ, schedule, devotionals, mode switch) |
| `firstAid` | All (read-only) | `camper:read`, `camper:read:sensitive`, `checkin:write` (attendance only). No notes, no admin, no pre-camp data. |

There is always exactly one `admin` account. It cannot be deleted or deactivated.

## Camp mode

`CampSettings.campMode: 'pre-camp' | 'at-camp'`

- Controls which tabs and admin tiles appear in the UI.
- Switched via `POST /admin/mode { campMode }`.
- Admin console is **identical in both modes** — admins can configure at-camp content (devotionals, schedule) while still in pre-camp mode.

## At-camp preview (client-side only)

Users in pre-camp mode can tap **"👁 Preview at-camp view"** on the pre-camp home screen to enter a read-only preview of the at-camp UI. This is **entirely client-side** — no backend change, no mode switch.

- **State:** `PREVIEW_MODE: boolean` (in-memory only, never persisted).
- **Entry:** `enterPreview()` — sets `PREVIEW_MODE=true`, flips `CAMP_MODE` to `'at-camp'` locally, shows amber `#previewBanner` strip, rebuilds tabs, navigates home.
- **Exit:** `exitPreview()` — restores `CAMP_MODE` from `SETTINGS.campMode`, removes banner, rebuilds tabs.
- **Write blocking:** the `api()` function short-circuits any non-GET request while `PREVIEW_MODE` is true — shows a toast and throws. Covers every write in the app without per-screen changes.
- **Logout safety:** `logout()` clears `PREVIEW_MODE=false` before POSTing to `/auth/logout` so the write guard never blocks logout itself.
- All roles can enter preview. Preview uses real live data (campers, schedule, devotionals already imported).

## Daily check-in (twice daily)

**De-linked from the schedule (2026-06-25).** Check-in sessions are now derived purely from
`CampSettings.checkInDays` — **two synthetic sessions per camp day** (Morning 08:00 / Afternoon
13:00), generated in `src/services/checkin-sessions.ts`. The schedule is unrelated to check-in
(it is pure plan communication); `ScheduleItem.isCheckInPoint` and `getCheckInPoints` no longer
exist.

- Session id = **`${day}~am` / `${day}~pm`** (e.g. `2026-09-28~pm`) — delimiter is `~`, URL-safe (a `#` would be parsed as a URL fragment when the id is put in a request path; SPA also `encodeURIComponent`s it); this is the key in
  `Camper.checkInHistory[].sessionId`.
- `getCurrentSession()` picks today's AM before midday / PM after (camp tz); falls back to the
  most recent past session. Both `checkin.service` and `dashboard.service` use the shared pure
  helper (`buildSessions` / `currentSession`).
- `checkInDays` is auto-generated from start/end dates in the admin Settings screen (each date
  inclusive); setting the start date pre-fills the end date to the 4th day.
- The frontend shows compact session labels (`Mon AM`, `Mon PM`).
- **Optimistic check-in queue** (`CHECKIN_QUEUE`): taps flip local state immediately and drain to the server in order. Retries with exponential backoff on network failure; hard-drops on 4xx. Undo toast gives 4-second reversal window.

## Presence model (P0 — critical invariant)

`atCamp` and `lifecycle` are **orthogonal**:

- `atCamp` — is the person **physically on site right now?** Only written by `withSignEvent` (attendance sign-in/sign-out path).
- `lifecycle` — registration state machine: `registered → arrived → checked_out → departed | cancelled`. Only `withSignEvent` advances this beyond `registered`.
- `withCheckIn` (daily session log) **never** touches `atCamp` or `lifecycle`. It appends to `checkInHistory` only.
- `checkIn()` in `person.service.ts` guards: throws `BadRequestError` for `lifecycle === 'cancelled'` OR `atCamp === false`. Day-1 first-arrival must go through `signEvent` (attendance sign-in), not the daily check-in path.
- The check-in roster in `getSessionStatus` filters on `p.atCamp === true`, not `isCamper(p)` — departed campers (`atCamp:false`) never appear on the daily roster.
- `checkInsDue` on the at-camp dashboard is scoped to `atCampNow` (persons with `atCamp===true`), not all `isCamper()` persons. This prevents departed campers inflating the "still to check in" count.

## Key design rules

- **RBAC in one file**: `src/services/access-control.ts`. Never scatter role checks.
- **Validation inside services**: all external input parsed with Zod inside the service, not the controller.
- **Repos return deep clones**: in-memory base repository clones on every read/write.
- **Accommodation lock**: `CampSettings.accommodationLocked` — server blocks non-admin writes when true.
- **Extensionless imports**: ESM, `moduleResolution: "Bundler"`, no `.js` extensions. Each folder has an `index.ts` barrel.
- **Strict TypeScript**: `strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `noImplicitOverride`. Guard all indexed access.

## Frontend files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `public/index.html` | Production SPA — rebuilt 2026-06-10 from the demo. UI redesigned 2026-06-23 (indigo/purple palette, Plus Jakarta Sans). |
| `ui-mocks.html` | Static HTML mock renders of all key screens — shows the redesigned UI and P0–P4 feature updates. Open in a browser. |
| `../youth app demo/camp-platform.html` | Standalone offline demo — all API calls handled by an embedded MockAPI. The **original UI source of truth**. |

## Design system (updated 2026-06-23)

All tokens live in `:root` in `public/index.html`. Do not use hardcoded hex values for these colours anywhere — use the CSS variables.

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--navy` | `#1e1b4b` | App background, header gradient end |
| `--blue` | `#4f46e5` | Primary buttons, active state, links |
| `--blue2` | `#818cf8` | Progress bar fills, secondary highlights |
| `--purple` | `#9333ea` | Tile icons, hero gradient start, pre-camp badge |
| `--violet` | `#7c3aed` | Button gradient start, header gradient start |
| `--teal` | `#06b6d4` | Devotional hero card |
| `--paper` | `#f5f4ff` | App background (light purple tint) |
| `--line` | `#e4e2f5` | Borders |

**Font:** Plus Jakarta Sans (Google Fonts, loaded in `<head>`). System font stack is the fallback.

**Header bar:** `linear-gradient(135deg, var(--violet), var(--navy))`.

**Hero cards:** `radial-gradient(130% 130% at 0% 0%, #9333ea, #1e1b4b 72%)` with two decorative pseudo-element circles.

**Tab bar active state:** pill background `#ede9fe` with `color: var(--blue)`. No underline indicator.

**Buttons:** `linear-gradient(135deg, var(--violet), var(--blue))`. `.btn.ghost` uses `#f1f0ff` background with `#3730a3` text.

## SPA ↔ backend contract (rebuild notes)

The SPA was forked from an earlier demo and had drifted onto the demo's **MockAPI contract**, which differs from the real Express API. When porting a screen from `camp-platform.html`, watch these (the rebuild fixed them all):

- **No envelope.** The backend returns results *bare* (`res.json(result)`); errors are an HTTP error status + `{code,message}`. `api()` returns the bare result and throws on non-2xx. (The demo's MockAPI used `{ok,data}` and `d.actor`; real login returns `{token,user}` and the SPA builds `ACTOR` + a client-side `displayName`.)
- **`/campers` returns a bare array**, not `{items}`. Camper `kind` is `'student'|'leader'`.
- **Check-in status** = `{session, roster:[{camperId,firstName,lastName,church,zone,gender,grade,medicalFlag,checkedIn,lastEntry}], checkedInCount, totalCount}` — roster now includes gender/grade/medicalFlag directly (no second `/campers` fetch needed).
- **Attendance** is `POST /attendance/sign-in|sign-out` with a `camperId` body (not `/campers/:id/sign-*`). Notes for a camper = `GET /notes/camper/:id`. Search reveal = `GET /search/contact/:camperId/:role` (role like `male-primary`).
- **`/home`** DTO differs by mode: pre-camp has `totalCampers/totalLeaders/noBlueCardCount/accommodationSummary[]/perChurchBreakdown[]` (no gender split, no church `code`, no `expected`); the by-ministry M/F table and church code are derived client-side from `/registrants` and `/accounts/churches`.
- **Accommodation** = blocks (`/accommodation/blocks`, with `price`) + per-church reservations (`POST /accommodation/reservations`) + `/accommodation/held/:churchId`. There is **no rooms/allocations model** — the demo's room-by-room placement was reworked to the per-church spot model. **Budget prices come from blocks** (settings has no price fields); there is no fee-tier.
- **Notes** require a `camperId`; a **testimony** is a note with `category:'testimony'` (so the testimonies screen picks a student). `/notes/recent` has no camper details (joined from `/campers`); `/notes/export` returns a **CSV string** (downloaded directly) with a Category column.
- **Admin paths**: `/accounts/users`, `/accounts/churches`, `/admin/defaults`, `DELETE /admin/notifications`, `/import/csv` (body `{csvData}`, CSV only), `/devotional/:day` (path param). Passwords are **min 8**. Church create needs `churchName`+`zone`+`account*` fields only. (Password edits use `POST /accounts/users/password` `{userId,password}`.)

> **Field removal (2026-06-25):** self-registration was dropped (all registrants arrive via CSV).
> Removed from `Church`: `code`, `selfRegisterSlug`, `expectedCount`, `youthPastorName`,
> `contactEmail` (church name + a **separate** login username are the identity; matching/import is
> by **name**). Removed from `CampSettings`: `checkInLocation`, `checkInFrom`, `registerBaseUrl`.
> Migrations `008`/`009` dropped the columns in prod. The SPA Accounts screen is now one row per
> login (leadership + churches) with rename/username/password/delete icon actions + a legend.

> **SPA perf (2026-06-25):** a 30s client `Cache` wraps GET in `api()` (invalidated on writes via
> `_invalidate`), `_prefetch()` warms common endpoints after login, and `_navTo` is
> stale-while-revalidate (shows the previous render instead of a spinner on revisits). The shell
> (header/tab bar) was already persistent. `sw.js` cache bumped to `camp-v2`.
- **`CamperDto`** includes `dateOfBirth` (added 2026-06-23) — available on all at-camp screens without a separate fetch.

**Backend additions made for the rebuild** (see git history): optional `StudentNote.category` (+ create-schema + enriched CSV export), `DELETE /notifications/:id`, and `contacts` added to `UpdateChurchSchema` (so the ministry-contacts editor can persist). The check-in screen handles an empty session list gracefully (note: `POST /admin/reset` re-seeds without schedule items, so no sessions exist until the schedule is configured).

## Known SPA efficiency rules (do not regress)

- `/registrants` is fetched **once** in `RENDER.home()` before the `isWide` branch — not once per branch.
- `renderOversightPulse()` does **not** fetch `/campers` — roster data (`gender`, `grade`, `medicalFlag`) comes directly from the `/checkin/sessions/:id/status` DTO.
- `renderHomeAtCamp()` fetches `/notifications` once in the initial `Promise.all`. The urgent-notice popup uses `_checkUrgentNoticesFromFeed(feed)` with the pre-fetched feed — never a second `/notifications` call.
- `renderOversightPulse()` is called without `await` from `renderHomeAtCamp()` — the home screen paints immediately and the pulse bars inject asynchronously into `#homePulse`.

## Seed demo accounts (password: `demo1234`)

Logins are **usernames**, not emails (`User.username`; case-insensitive). Real
contact emails live on Person/Church, separate from the login id. The demo
quick-login panel only appears on localhost/dev (gated by `_initDemoLogin()`).

| Username | Role | Church/Zone |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `victory` | church | Victory Church · Yellow |
| `gracepoint` | church | Grace Point Church · Blue |
| `riverbend` | church | Riverbend Community · Green |
| `yellowzone` | zoneLeader | Yellow Zone |
| `director` | director | — |
| `admin` | admin | — |

Passwords are min 6 chars. Admin can create/edit accounts (editable username +
uniqueness), set passwords, and activate/deactivate (`toggleStatus`; the sole admin
can't be deactivated).

## Year-to-year reuse  (reset vs new-year semantics — decided 2026-06-18)

1. Admin sets up churches, accounts, accommodation, FAQ, schedule, devotionals.
2. `POST /admin/defaults` (`saveDefaults`) — snapshots the scaffold (churches, accounts,
   accommodation, FAQ, schedule, **devotionals**) as the baseline. Snapshot strips
   password hashes.
3. After camp: `POST /admin/new-year` (`newYear`) — the **routine rollover**: purges
   people + transient data (registrants/campers/notes/notifications) and **restores**
   the scaffold from the baseline snapshot; keeps the admin account + camp settings
   (bumps year, forces pre-camp). **Requires a saved snapshot.** Restored accounts come
   back password-less (snapshot strips hashes) — operator must set passwords (KNOWN RISK R9).
4. `POST /admin/reset` (`reset`) — **full wipe to bare**: deletes ALL data including the
   scaffold and every non-admin account; keeps only the single admin + camp settings.
   **No** snapshot restore (this fixed defect A4, where reset used to load the snapshot
   then never restore from it).

Both destructive ops use bulk `deleteAll()` (Supabase: `TRUNCATE`), not row-by-row deletes.
